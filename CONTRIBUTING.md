# Contribution

There are mainly two areas you could contribute in:
- Improving [scraper.py](scraper.py) (do mind, however, that Moodle will soon be taken down);
- Downloading new content and uploading to this repo.

## Adding new content

If there are any additional contents you would like to upload to this repo,
you might choose do the following:

1. Cloning this repo (you might want to check out partial clones, if you don't want to clone the entire thing).
2. Scrape/download the contents by hand, and place them into the directory in the same way 
   as the other files are placed (create folders if you need to).
3. Commit and create a pull request.

*Note: If you are trying to access Moodle without school internet, you might also want to 
check out this [browser extension](https://github.com/abu-co/CHS-Moodle-Fixer) I made.*
